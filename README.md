# tmdb-eda
My first exploritory data analysis project in Python, on the TMDB_movies dataset. This was a one day project. I use Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn and Matplotlib were both used for the visualisations.

To ensure the notebook functions properly, please ensure that TMDB_movies.csv is in the same location as the TaiChen_TMDB notebook.
